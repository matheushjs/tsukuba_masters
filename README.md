Reducing Model Size Without losing Prediction Accuracy
===

- The objective of this project is to find theoretical means to apply machine learning on chaotic time series without using oversized learning models.

- One way to do this is reduce the model size of an existing algorithm, such as that of Okuno, Aihara, Hirata (2020), but maintain its prediction accuracy.
